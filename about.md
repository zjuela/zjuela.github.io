I am now a Research Scientist at [Light Co.](https://light.co). I received my Phd in Computer Science at [University of California, Merced](http://www.ucmerced.edu/), working with Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/). 
                                
My research interests include computational photography and computer vision, especially on developing algorithms for image restoration.
                               
Prior to that, I got my B.S. in mathematics (Honors) from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2009.
